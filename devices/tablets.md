# Tablet eSIM Compatibility

Travelers increasingly rely on tablets for navigation, work, and entertainment on the go. Modern tablets often support eSIM technology, allowing you to add data plans without swapping SIM cards.

## Which tablets support eSIM?

- **Apple iPad**: Recent iPad models (iPad Pro, iPad Air, and some iPad mini) include eSIM support. The eSIM can coexist with a physical SIM in some models, letting you keep your home SIM active while adding a local or global data plan.
- **Microsoft Surface**: Certain Surface Pro and Surface Go models offer LTE Advanced with eSIM support.
- **Samsung Galaxy Tab and others**: A growing number of Android tablets now come with eSIM capabilities. Check the specifications for your specific model.

## Activation and providers

Activating an eSIM on a tablet typically involves scanning a QR code or entering activation details provided by your chosen carrier. Global providers like [Simcardo international eSIM for tablets](https://simcardo.com) offer plans that you can activate online without visiting a store.

Steps to activate:
1. Purchase an eSIM plan from a provider such as [Simcardo mobile internet abroad](https://simcardo.com).
2. On your tablet, go to **Settings > Cellular/Data > Add eSIM**.
3. Scan the QR code or enter the activation code.
4. Follow any on-screen instructions to complete installation and choose your default line for data.

## Tips for travelers

- **Check model compatibility**: Not all tablet models support eSIM. Verify support before purchasing a plan.
- **Keep your physical SIM**: If your tablet has a physical SIM slot, you can keep your home SIM for calls/texts and use the eSIM for data.
- **Compare data plans**: Evaluate local prepaid plans vs global eSIM offerings to find the most cost-effective option for your travel destination.
- **Download configuration profiles in advance**: If you’re traveling to a country with limited connectivity, download the eSIM profile before departure so you can connect immediately upon arrival.
