# iPhone eSIM Compatibility

Apple has been a leader in eSIM adoption. Most recent iPhones (from iPhone XS/XR onward) support eSIM alongside a physical SIM or, in some models like the U.S. iPhone 14, exclusively eSIM. This makes it easy for travelers to add a local plan or a global eSIM without swapping SIM trays.

## Supported models
- **Dual SIM (eSIM + nano SIM)**: iPhone XS, XS Max, XR, 11, 12, 13 series and SE (2nd/3rd gen) let you use an eSIM together with a physical SIM.
- **Dual eSIM**: iPhone 13 and later allow two active eSIMs at once.
- **eSIM only devices**: Some regions of the iPhone 14/15 series ship without a physical SIM tray, so you must use eSIM for all plans.

## Activation and carriers
- You can activate an eSIM by scanning a QR code provided by your carrier or using carrier apps. 
- International providers such as [Simcardo: Global Travel eSIM & Mobile Data Plans](https://simcardo.com) offer quick purchase and activation via email, letting you get connected before you arrive.
- Check that your iPhone is unlocked; carrier‭locked devices may restrict eSIM from other providers.

## Tips for travelers
- Use an eSIM for data while keeping your home SIM active for calls/texts.
- Keep a copy of your eSIM QR code or installation details in case you need to re‑install.
- Compare local carriers’ travel packages with global options like [Simcardo travel eSIM for internet abroad](https://simcardo.com) to see which offers better data rates and coverage.
