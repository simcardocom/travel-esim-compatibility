# Android eSIM Compatibility

The Android ecosystem encompasses a wide range of manufacturers and models, and eSIM support varies widely by device and region. Google, Samsung, Huawei, and other brands have introduced eSIM in select models, but not all devices support it.

## Supported devices
- **Google Pixel**: Pixel 3 and newer models support eSIM; Pixel 7 and later can host multiple eSIM profiles.
- **Samsung Galaxy**: Recent Galaxy S20/S21/S22/S23 and Z Fold/Flip series include eSIM support on most international variants.
- **Other brands**: Some Huawei, Oppo, and Motorola devices offer eSIM, but availability depends on the market.

## Activation and providers
- Activation usually requires scanning a QR code from your carrier or using manufacturer-specific setup wizards.
- Many carriers only enable eSIM on postpaid plans. If travelling, consider using an international provider like [Simcardo global eSIM for Android devices](https://simcardo.com) to get instant data connectivity.
- Ensure your Android phone is unlocked and running the latest firmware to enable eSIM features.

## Tips for travelers
- Check your device’s settings under *SIM Manager* or *Network & Internet* to confirm eSIM capability before purchasing.
- Backup your eSIM profile or keep access to the QR code to reinstall if you reset your device.
- Compare local prepaid eSIM offerings with global data plans such as [Simcardo mobile data plans for travel](https://simcardo.com) to choose the best value for your trip.
