# Travel eSIM Compatibility  

A practical reference for eSIM compatibility across countries and devices.  

This repository is built for travelers and travel-tech builders who want a  
simple overview of where eSIM is generally supported, what devices work,  
and what common limitations to expect.  

## What’s inside  
- Country notes by region  
- Device compatibility notes (iPhone / Android / tablets)  
- A simple dataset you can reuse (CSV)  

## Scope & disclaimer
