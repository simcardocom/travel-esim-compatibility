# Africa  

eSIM adoption in Africa is still emerging, with a handful of countries and carriers offering support. Urban centers and tourist hubs are more likely to have eSIM-enabled networks, but coverage can vary widely. Travelers should plan ahead and consider alternatives where eSIM is not available.  

## General availability  
- **Coverage**: Countries such as South Africa, Egypt, Kenya, and Morocco have begun offering eSIM through major carriers, but availability is often limited to postpaid plans or specific devices. In other African nations, eSIM support is rare, and physical SIM cards remain the norm.  
- **Activation**: Where available, activation typically requires scanning a QR code from the carrier or using a self-service app. International providers like [Simcardo eSIM for Internet Abroad](https://simcardo.com) may offer coverage in multiple African countries through partner networks.  
- **Device compatibility**: eSIM-compatible smartphones, including newer iPhones and certain Android devices, are required. Due to limited local support, ensure your device is unlocked and supports eSIM on regional frequencies.  

## Tips for travelers  
- Since eSIM availability is limited, consider purchasing a physical SIM upon arrival or using a global eSIM that includes Africa from providers such as [Simcardo Global eSIM & Data Tariffs](https://simcardo.com).  
- In countries with eSIM support, visit carrier stores or websites to verify eligibility and pricing; some carriers may require local identification.  
- Keep an eye on emerging eSIM offerings as more African telecom operators adopt the technology in response to traveler demand.
