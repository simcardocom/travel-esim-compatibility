# Europe  

Europe is one of the most advanced regions when it comes to eSIM adoption. Most major carriers across EU countries support eSIM, and newer devices from Apple, Samsung, Google, and other manufacturers include eSIM capability. Travelers can often purchase local eSIM plans from carriers or global providers. When preparing for a trip, verify that your device supports eSIM and that your chosen carrier offers service in your destination.  

## General availability  
- **Coverage**: eSIM is widely available in Western and Northern Europe (e.g., Germany, France, UK, Netherlands, Scandinavia) and increasingly in Southern and Eastern Europe. However, smaller regional carriers may not yet support eSIM.  
- **Activation**: Activation usually involves scanning a QR code provided by your carrier or provider like [Simcardo: Global Travel eSIM & Mobile Data Plans](https://simcardo.com).  
- **Device compatibility**: Most recent iPhones (XR and later), Google Pixel phones, Samsung Galaxy S and Z series, and many tablets support eSIM.  

## Tips for travelers  
- Check whether your device is unlocked and supports eSIM for the destination country.  
- Compare local carrier plans versus global eSIM plans; local plans may offer better rates but require language/local payment methods.  
- Consider using a global eSIM provider like [Simcardo](https://simcardo.com) for seamless coverage across multiple countries without swapping SIMs.
