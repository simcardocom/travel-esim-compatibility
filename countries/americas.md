# Americas  

The Americas encompass a wide range of eSIM readiness. North America (United States and Canada) leads with strong eSIM adoption across major carriers and a variety of eSIM-only devices. In Latin America, support is growing but can be inconsistent between countries and carriers. Always check whether your device supports eSIM and whether a local carrier offers plans.  

## General availability  
- **Coverage**: eSIM is widely supported in the United States and Canada with carriers like AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Rogers, and Bell. In Central and South America, countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and Chile have begun rolling out eSIM on select networks, but availability may vary. Caribbean islands often rely on traditional SIMs.  
- **Activation**: Activation in the Americas usually requires scanning a QR code from the carrier or entering details via an app. Global providers such as [Simcardo Travel eSIM Plans](https://simcardo.com) can simplify activation for travelers.  
- **Device compatibility**: Most recent Apple iPhones (XR and newer), Google Pixel models, Samsung flagships, and some carrier-branded phones support eSIM. Always confirm your model’s eSIM capability and whether it is unlocked.  

## Tips for travelers  
- For the U.S. and Canada, eSIM plans from local carriers provide competitive data rates, but you may need a local billing address or credit card.  
- If traveling through multiple countries in Latin America, consider a regional or global eSIM from providers like [Simcardo Global Mobile Data](https://simcardo.com) to avoid swapping SIM cards at each border.  
- Keep in mind that rural areas and smaller carriers may not support eSIM, so having a backup physical SIM or a device with dual SIM capability is useful.
